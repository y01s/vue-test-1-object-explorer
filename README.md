## Instructions

Create a fork of this repository to push your code to.

Your aim is to create a very simple visualizer and editor for nested objects,
like the one we put in the `obj` of the main instance.

Your missions:
1. Visualize the object clearly, like in the console or react-dev-tools
2. Allow edition of property values
3. Allow edition of property names

Timing: 1h
